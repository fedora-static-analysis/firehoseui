Django projects are not convenient to distribute as python packages, nor is it
convenient to deploy a python package as a WSGI app. Django does however make
it easy to write reusable apps that can be distributed as python packages.
Thus, these steps are expected for deployment of firehoseui:

1) install package "firehoseui" through usual means (hint: virtualenv with pip)

2) copy the "project" tree to somewhere within /var/www/, and deploy it as a
normal django WSGI app that uses the virtualenv from step 1
